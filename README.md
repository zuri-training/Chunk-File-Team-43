<h1>Project: Chunk File</h1>
<h2>Team: Team 43</h2>
<h3>Project Name: ChunkIt</h3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>ChunkIt is a web application that is basically used for splitting larges CSV and JSON files that are not possible to upload or download. 
Using our web app, the user will decide the size or number of segments to split the file into. The web app will be able to split files into tiny 
segments as requested by the user and return the chunked bits as it's original format all compressed in a zip file. Our web app will be limited to two files 
type (CSV and JSON) but in a future update, Chunit will be used for more file types. By using our web app, users can easily split files into smaller segments or chunks which can either be downloaded immediately or saved for later download.
We will have two modules, one for segmentation and the other for the splitting of files.</p>

<h2>Project Stacks</h2>
<p>We will be using the following technologies to achieve the project</p>
<h4>Backend Stacks</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Python- Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is a general language that can be used to build any type of program or application.</li>
    <li>Django- Django is a high-level python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design. Django makes it easy to build web apps quickly with less code.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Frontend Stacks</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Javascript- Javascript is a popular programming language used in creating a dynamic and interactive web application. It will be used for client-side programming.</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS- HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies in building web pages. HTML provides the structure of the pages while CSS is used for the styling of the pages.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Database</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL will be use for database management. It is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It will be used for storing the user's information in a database.
</p>
<h4>Version Control</h4>
<p>Git and Github will be use as version control and collaboration environment during the process of developing the web app</p>
<h4>Deployment</h4>
<p>Heroku Deployment will be used for deploying to a Live Server.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<h4>Module for file splitting</h4>
<p>This module will split the files into the segment that is selected by the user. The python panda module will be use to acheive this</p>
<h4>Module for file zipping</h4>
<p>This module will be use in adding the splitted files into a zip archive for easier download. The Python zipfile will be used to achieve this.</p>
